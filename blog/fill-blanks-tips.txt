<h4>Strategies and Tips</h4>
<h4>Before filling in the blanks</h4>
<p>Read the text carefully without the blanks. Your goal for this first reading should be to derive the topic/point/idea of the academic text. This will come handy when you try to fill in the blanks with the appropriate word choices.</p>
<h4>While filling in the blanks</h4>
<p>In your first attempt, fill blanks one by one. Only fill blanks that you are sure of, if you are unsure of any blank, skip it. The reason being once you answer the easy blanks, it will be easier to fill the remaining blanks correctly.</p>
<p>When judging the appropriateness of a word choice for a blank always check if it meets the grammatical and common sense criteria.</p>
<p>When making the word choice, always check if it makes grammatical sense in the context of the sentence. The word choices may contain synonyms. Understanding the grammar of the sentence can help you make the right choice. Furthermore, the grammatical context of the sentence will tell you if the word needs to be singular or plural. To verify if the word makes grammatical sense, check if it maintains relationship with the pronouns (such as they, these, he etc.) and logical connectors (and, but, hence etc.)in the sentence. Other grammatical cues can be derived from the tenses, articles, type of sentence to name a few. Checking for grammar is an art and what strategy you use will vary depending on the sentence and the word choices you have. Overall, you should see that the word choice fits in with the grammar of the sentence.</p>
<p>Next step is to check if the word choice for the blank meets the common sense criteria in the context of the sentence and the text. Common sense criteria checks if the word choice fits correctly and is in line with the larger message of the sentence and the text. This strategy is helpful when you have antonyms in the word choice and both words make grammatical sense. For such blanks, apply the common sense criteria after you have got all the easy blanks right. Re-read the text to get its gist. The word which fits in with the overall message of the text will be the correct choice.</p>
<h4>After filling in the blanks</h4>
<p>Re-read the text to see if the word choices fit in with the message of the text and make sense. If you have doubts about a blank; apply the trial and error method with remaining word choices and re-read the text to see if it makes sense. Apply these steps, till your word choices reflect the author's intended message in the text and you are sure of your answer.</p>
