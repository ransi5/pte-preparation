After some practice, you will realize that re-tell lecture is just as easy as repeat sentence or read aloud question types and you will be ready to face the biggest re-tell lecture monster questions that PTE may throw at you with ease.</p>
<h4>The task</h4>
<p>Re-tell lecture is a long answer speaking item type that has 3-4 questions. You will be assessed on speaking as well as listening skills. The task entails that you listen to an academic lecture and then give a presentation based on what you have heard and understood, within 40 seconds. In this item type, PTE Academic tests your ability to give an oral presentation on information that you acquire from listening.</p>
<p>The top section of the screen for the re-tell lecture question will contain instructions. These instructions will always be the same and will say something to affect that "You will hear a lecture. After listening to the lecture, in 10 seconds, please speak into the microphone and retell what you just heard from the lecture in your own words". These instruction will remain same for all questions in this item type. You must know what the instructions are but do not spend time reading this information during the PTE test. According to the instructions, you will hear a lecture, 10 seconds after the lecture, the microphone will open to record your response and you will have 40 seconds to finish your answer. The 10 seconds after the lecture is your preparation time.</p>
<p>Note that the instructions stress that you have to retell the lecture in your own words. Some test takers think re-tell lecture is about memorizing the lecture and then saying it in the exact same words. This strategy will cost you points. Re-tell lecture is about repeating what you have heard and understood about the macro and micro subjects, in your own words. Are you wondering, how to go about understanding and identifying macro and micro subjects. Well, worry not, this topic is covered in our next blog "Re-tell lecture - How to get the scores you need in one attempt".</p>
<p>Below the instructions, on the left, there may be an image related to the lecture that you will hear. On the right of the screen, besides the image, there will be two boxes. The top box will be your audio player and the box below it will be your audio recorder. When the screen opens the audio player will countdown from 3 seconds to the point when the lecture starts playing. The audio recorder will countdown the time to the point when the microphone will open to record your answer. The countdown time for the audio recorder will vary with the length of the audio lecture and will be different for every re-tell question. The formula for recorder's countdown time = 3 seconds + length of lecture + 10 seconds. How this information is useful is covered in our next blog "Re-tell lecture: How to get the scores you need in one attempt".</p>
<p>Be Advised, the PTE recorder automatically stops recording after 3 seconds silence. So start speaking within 2 seconds of microphone opening and do not take any pauses longer than 3 seconds. Some students try to beat the recorder by making a humming noise. This does not help. The machine scoring system is clever. It will identify this noise and your score will be affected.</p>

<p>The machine scoring system will mark you on the following 3 enabling skills to measure your aptitude in the above mentioned sub skills.</p>
<ul style="color:black;">
<li>Content</li>
<li>Pronunciation</li>
<li>Oral Fluency</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 enabling skills comprise all the sub skills mentioned earlier that the machine scoring system will be looking at and you will need to display in your answers.

This score is than allocated to communicative skill of speaking and listening; and to your overall score.</p>
<h4>Content</h4>
<p>Content, is the first enabling skill that will be scored by the machine scoring system. The maximum score for content is 5 and the minimum score is 0. If you score 0 (which is quite difficult unless you don't attempt the question) the machine scoring system will not mark you on other enabling skills and your score for that particular question will be 0.</p>
<p>You get the maximum score 5, if you re-tell all the points in the lecture. You describe characters, aspects or actions and their relationships, possible developments, conclusion or implications.
