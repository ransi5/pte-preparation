<p>Reading multiple-choice, choose multiple answers item type is similar to multiple-choice, choose single answer item type. The only difference being is that the length of the text is longer and there is more than one correct answer. All it takes to do well in this item type is a little practice and most PTE test takers manage to do pretty well. However, there are few question types, like where the test taker is supposed to infer the gist of the reading text, which most PTE test takers struggle with. Then there is the element of time, where students spend too much time to get the answers right. The strategies and tips to overcome these problems are same as for multiple-choice, choose single answer. However, for completeness sake, in this blog, we will suggest strategies and tips, tweaked up for this item type, that will help you overcome these difficulties.</p>
<h4>The task</h4>
<p>Multiple-choice, choose multiple answers is a reading item type that assesses reading skills only. There are generally 2-3 questions in this item type. The aim of this item type is to assess your ability to analyze, interpret and evaluate a short text. It is a multiple choice question where you will have to read a text and then choose more than one correct response.</p>
<p>On the left side of the screen, you will find the text that you have to analyze, interpret and evaluate while reading. Beside the text, on the right side of the screen, you will find the question. The top section of the screen will contain instructions. The instruction will say something to the effect "Read the text and answer the question by selecting all correct responses. More than one response is correct.". These instructions will remain same for all questions in this item type, so do not waste time reading them but understand and be aware of the instructions. Below the instructions you will find the question followed by response options.</p>
<h4>Scoring</h4>
<p>The communicative skill scored in this section is reading. </p>
<p>The reading sub skills tested in this section are dependent on the question and could be any of the following: identifying the topic, theme or main ideas; identifying the relationships between sentences and paragraphs; evaluating the quality and usefulness of texts; identifying a writer’s purpose, style, tone or attitude; identifying supporting points or examples; reading for overall organization and connections between pieces of information; reading for information to infer meanings or find relationships; identifying specific details, facts, opinions, definitions or sequences of events; inferring the meaning of unfamiliar words. You can interpret these sub skills as the task that the question may require you to perform and the purpose with which you read the text.</p>
<p>Reading multiple-choice is first of the 3 item types where negative marking applies, You score 1 for every correct choice and -1 for every incorrect choice. The minimum you can score is 0. Which means if you have 3 incorrect responses and no correct response, your score for this item type will be 0 and not -3.</p>
<h4>Strategies and tips</h4>
<p>For this item type we will present the strategies and tips for various activities that you have to perform to select the correct answer. The activities are divided into 3 parts namely "Before reading", "during reading" and "after reading".</p>
<h4>Before Reading</h4>
<p>What some test takers do is, as soon as the screen for this question type opens, they jump straight to reading the text or they read the question and the options and quickly jump to the text to find the information in the question. These strategies are not the most efficient. You may get the correct answer with these strategies but you may spend too much effort and time than required for the question.</p>
<p>Reading MCQ, choose single answer questions are not randomly selected texts. If you paid attention while reading the paragraph on sub skills tested in the scoring section of this blog, you would have learned that the questions for this item type are selected to test one or more reading sub skills. The reason this is important is because if you can identify the reading sub skills that Pearson intends to test in the given question; you have the broad purpose with which to read the text. Remember that pearson could test you on more than one sub skill in each question of this item type. So, you may have more than one purpose with which to read the text. These sub skills/purpose of reading are</p>
<ul style="color:black">
<li>Identifying the topic, theme or main ideas</li>
<li>identifying the relationships between sentences and paragraphs; </li>
<li>evaluating the quality and usefulness of texts;</li>
<li>identifying a writer’s purpose, style, tone or attitude;</li>
<li>identifying supporting points or examples;</li>
<li>reading for overall organization and connections between pieces of information;</li>
<li>reading for information to infer meanings or find relationships;</li>
<li>identifying specific details, facts, opinions, definitions or sequences of events;</li>
<li>inferring the meaning of unfamiliar words;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of the above facts, your strategy should be first to read the question. You read the question to infer the purpose with which to read the text. You then read the options to infer what the passage is likely to be about. At the same time you mark key words. Key words are words that while skimming and scanning the text will give you the approximate location where the answer is likely to be.</p>
<h4>While Reading</h4>
<p>After you have read the question; and the options; and have inferred the sub skills the question intends to test; and the purpose of your reading along with key words; it is time to read the text. Read the text with a purpose. Once again, this purpose is the sub skills pearson intends to test you for the particular question. Along with the purpose that you identified while reading the question, you should always read with a purpose to identify the structure of the text and to understand the overall point of the text. The goal of these purposes is to help you identify where in the text the answers are likely to be. If you struggle to achieve the goal of all purposes in one reading; you may read it 2 or 3 times. As you read, identify and remember the areas in the text where the keywords or their synonyms appear.</p>
<p>If you manage to identify the answers in your first two or three readings, jump to the after reading strategy. If not, then skim and scan looking for keywords and their synonyms and read the portion of the text around the keywords in detail. If this strategy does not get you the single correct answer; read the question and options again to check if you had identified the purpose correctly and update your keywords. Repeat the skim and scan process again till you get the correct answers.</p>
<h4>After Reading</h4>
<p>After you have marked the single correct answer, it is time to assess the probability of other options being right. Read the other options one by one. If you carried out the steps in "during reading" strategy, you should have the gist and structure of the text on your fingertips. This will allow you to completely eliminate some options. If you come across options that you are not sure of or you think might be correct, make a note of keywords for that option. Skim and scan the text for the keywords and their synonyms. Read the text around the keywords in detail till you have eliminated all probability of the option being correct or are sure of correct answers.</p>
<p>Remember negative marking applies for this question type. Choose options as correct that you are 100% sure of or you may loose points.</p>
