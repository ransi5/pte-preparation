<h4>While Listening</h4>
<p>You know the purpose of your listening is to identify missing words at the end of the recording. To do so correctly you have to perform various tasks as you listen. You will have to understand the speech to choose the correct option that does not change the speakers intended message. You will have to remember the last sentence to choose words that will make grammatical sense in the context of the last sentence.</p>
<p>To achieve the above goals while listening, apply your most powerful tool "IMAGINATION". Imagine, you are listening to a phone call. When on a phone call, you know you have to respond when the speaker stops, so you listen carefully to comprehend the message; you choose to remember information that is relevant, you predict what the speaker is going to say next and simultaneously prepare what your response is going to be. You don't make notes or memorize the message word by word; you simply remember the main and sub topics of the conversation.</p>
<p>Listening for select missing word is no different. This is not a re-tell lecture item type. The machine scoring system does not expect you to repeat the lecture. What is expected is that you predict and choose from a set of options, the last few words of the speaker. So, listen as if you are on a phone call from a friend who is giving you the most exciting information; when the call drops and you miss the last few words. Let comprehending the message be your sole focus.</p>
<p>To make the audio content a part of yourself apply associative techniques. This includes that as you listen and comprehend information; link it to your experiences and knowledge base that you tried to recall during the preparation time. This technique will etch the message in your memory; it will help you comprehend the complete message and most importantly, it will help you predict what the content of the audio is likely to be .</p>
<p>As you listen keep an eye on the progress bar of the audio player. When it reaches near the end, you know you are going to hear the last sentence. Repeat the last sentence, word by word, behind the speaker with a goal to memorize the sentence. When the audio stops write down what you memorized in your notebook.</p>
<h4>While Answering</h4>
<p>To get the correct answer for select missing word apply the trial and error method. Simply put each option at the end of the last sentence of the speech that you memorized and wote down in your notebook. The answer that meets the common sense and grammatical criteria will be your correct answer.</p>
<p>The common sense criteria will be met if the option clearly communicates the speaker's intended message for the sentence and for the entire speech.</p>
