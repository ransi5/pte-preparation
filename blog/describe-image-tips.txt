<h4>The task</h4>
<p>Describe image is a long answer speaking item type that has 6 or 7 questions. You will be assessed only on your speaking skills. The task entails that you describe an image on screen within 40 seconds. In this item type, PTE Academic tests your ability to describe an image from an academic source.</p>
<p>The top section of the screen for the describe image question will contain instructions. These will almost always be the same and will say something to affect that "Look at the graph below. In 25 seconds, please speak into the micro phone and describe in detail what the graph is showing. You will have 40 seconds to give your response". The time to prepare is 25 seconds, and time to give your answer is 40 seconds. The instructions will remain same for all questions in this item type. The only piece of information that varies and is important to note in instructions is the type of image. The image could be a graph, picture, map, chart or table. The reason you must make note of this information is because you may use this same word in your response to describe the type of image in the introduction part. Many test takers are confused about what to call the image in their response. Be confused no more.</p>
<p>At the center of the screen, on the left there will be an image that you have to describe and on the right, there will be the audio recorder with a timer. The timer will count down from 25 seconds. After, the preparation time of 25 seconds, you will hear a short tone. Soon after tone, the audio recorder status will change to "recording" and the microphone opens to record your answer.</p>
<p>Be Advised, the PTE recorder automatically stops recording after 3 seconds of silence. Students often try to beat the recorder by making a humming noise. This does not help. The machine scoring system will identify this noise and your score will be affected.</p>
